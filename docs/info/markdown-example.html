{% load pytags %}
{# title=Markdown embedded into html template #}

{% markdown %}
Hello World!
============

Now you can write markdown in your templates. This is good because:

* Markdown is awesome
* Markdown is less verbose than writing html by hand
* The page title is: {{ page.title }}

Note how you can use other template constructs inside the markdown section.

Back to home: {% link "index.html" %}

{% endmarkdown %}
