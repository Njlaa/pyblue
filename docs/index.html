Welcome to PyBlue
=================

- - -

A simple static site generator. Zero configuration. Works with any existing site.

PyBlue allows the reuse of data and visuals (header/footer) across many pages
and it can generate static sites from dynamic templates.

This page was created with PyBlue from the file located in <a href="https://github.com/ialbert/pyblue/tree/master/docs/index.html">docs/src/index.html</a>.

### Why PyBlue?

There is no shortage of static html generators. PyBlue is a personal project
that aims to address my personal annoyances with other options. I have evaluated
quite a few alternatives even used some options over longer periods
of time. Neither of the choices did everything I needed for my work.
Hence came the motivation to write my own static site generator.

The following are some of the reasons why PyBlue exists:

1. Pyblue requires no initial configuration, special file naming scheme to get started. Pyblue will work with existing html files. Every feature is optional!
1. Automatic linking!  Pyblue can be told to produce correct links automatically.
   What this means is that one can freely reorganize the site at any time without having to worry about broken links.
1. Pyblue can embed and syntax highlight code.
1. Pyblue integrates seamlessly with Markdown.
1. Pyblue can be told to load data into any page. The template system can operate on this data.
1. Advanced templating [Django Templating][django] system and all that it offers.
1. [Bootstrap][bootstrap] integration. Handy shortcuts to Bootstrap features.
1. Tiny codebase. PyBlue is around 500 lines of code. Runs on Python 2.7 and 3.4 as well.

### Install

Install it with `easy_install pyblue` or `pip install pyblue --upgrade`, or download it from
the [PyBlue PyPI](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyblue/) site.

**Note:** Version 2.0 of pyblue moved from Mako Templates to Django Templates and
with that introduced other semantic differences.
To install the last version of the `1.*` line use: `easy_install pyblue==1.1.2` or `pip install pyblue=1.1.2`.
See also the previous docs at: [Pyblue 1.1.2](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyblue/1.1.2)

### Usage

1. Launch pyblue to serve a directory. Serve these docs: `pyblue serve -r docs`.
1. View your site by visiting `http:://localhost:8080`.
1. Edit your files  and make changes. Reload your page to see the effect.

Once the site is done generate the final static output

1. `pyblue make -r docs -o html`
1. Upload the files to your static server

To see extra help on options run: `pyblue -h`

### Features

- - -

#### Context

The pages are rendered through the Django Template engine.
Users automatically get additional context for each of the pages as
variables that exists. For example the
{% verbatim %}<code>{{ page }}</code>{% endverbatim %} variable is always available:

* Writing: {% verbatim %}<code>{{ page.name }}</code>{% endverbatim %} will produce: {{ page.name }}
* Writing: {% verbatim %} <code>{{ page.last_modified }}</code> {% endverbatim %}
  will produce: {{ page.last_modified }}
* Writing: {% verbatim %} <code>{{ page.size|filesizeformat }}</code> {% endverbatim %}
  will produce: {{ page.size|filesizeformat }}

Note how in this last case we also made use of the <code>filesizeformat</code> builtin filter from Django.
Users may add more information even load a python module into the page.
More details on the {% link "context.html" %} page.

- - -

#### Links

To access more advanced features users must add the pyblue tag loader into each page:
{% verbatim %}<code>{% load pytags %}</code>{% endverbatim %}. Once this is added to a page
users can make use of pyblue specific tags.
For example {% verbatim %}<code>{% link "context.html" %}</code>{% endverbatim %} will
produce the following: {% link "context.html" %}.

How does that work? The {% verbatim %}<code>{% link "context.html" %}</code>{% endverbatim %}
command performs a regular expression search on all files in the directory and
once it finds a match it produces a link to it with the proper path.
This keeps links correct even after a file is moved! Note how in this
case the file is located in <code>info/context.html</code>

Note that the search string is a regular expression that does not need a full path to the file.
It is sufficient to specify the shortest unambiguous part of the filename PyBlue will find
it and link it.

- - -

#### Markdown

To include markdown content place it between

<pre>
{% verbatim %}{% markdown %}

Hello **Markdown**!

{% endmarkdown %}{% endverbatim %}
</pre>

template tags.

- - -

#### Fenced code blocks

When using markdown fenced codeblocks with highlighting hints can be used:

<pre>
```python
for line in open("data.txt"):
    print line.strip()[:10]
```
</pre>

will  render as:

```python
for line in open("data.txt"):
    print line.strip()[:10]
```

- - -

#### Include code

To include syntax highlighted code from a file write {% verbatim %}<code>{% code "context.py" hint="python" %}</code>{% endverbatim %}

{% code "context.py" hint="python"%}

Add {% verbatim %}<code>{% pygments_css %}</code>{% endverbatim %} to the header of the page to
generate the CSS classes needed to syntax color embedded code.

This file is also special because of its name: `context.py`. The contents of
this python module are available inside every page under the name of `context`. For example
writing {% verbatim %}`{{ context.greeting }}`{% endverbatim %} produces: {{ context.greeting }}.
Hence we can add more complex datastructures into every page.

- - -

#### Include markdown

Alternatively one can instruct PyBlue to include the rendered content of markdown files.
For example to include `example.md` in original form one would use
{% verbatim %}<code>{% code "example.md" %}{% endverbatim %}</code> this would produce:

{%  code "example.md" %}

This same file could be included as html with {% verbatim %}<code>{% include_markdown "example.md" %}{% endverbatim %}</code>
In that case it will produce the following:

{% include_markdown "example.md" %}

- - -

#### Include other templates

The django templating system allows including other templates or sections.

{% verbatim %}<code>{% include "sometemplate.html" %}{% endverbatim %}</code>

- - -

#### Bootstrap

There are helper methods for [Bootstrap][bootstrap].

For example {% verbatim %}<code>{% boostrap_cdn %}</code>{% endverbatim %} will include
the CSS and Javascript files used with Boostrap.
