Welcome to Pyblue
=================

A simple static site generator. Zero configuration. Works with any existing site.

PyBlue allows the reuse of data and visuals (header/footer) across many pages
and it can generate static sites from dynamic templates.

PyBlue also makes it easy to use [Markdown][markdown] inside of  webpages.

This file is located in <code><a href="https://github.com/ialbert/pyblue/tree/master/docs/index.html">docs/src/index.html</a></code>
of the <a href="https://github.com/ialbert/pyblue">PyBlue distribution</a>.


Why PyBlue?
----------

There is no shortage of static html generators. PyBlue is a personal project
that aims to address my personal annoyances with other options. I have evaluated
quite a few alternatives, some for many months yet slowly each drove me nuts.
Hence the motivation to write my own.
The following are some of the reasons why PyBlue exists:

1. No configuration or predetermined naming.
1. Automatic linking! Pyblue will produce the correct links even when files are moved around.
1. Embed code/files with syntax highlighting.
1. Load python data structures into pages.
1. Advanced templating: [Django Templating][django] system and all
 that it offers.
1. [Bootstrap][bootstrap] integration. Handy shortcuts to Bootstrap features.
1. Tiny codebase. PyBlue is around 500 lines of code. Runs on Python 2.7 and 3.4 as well.

Install
-------

Install it with `easy_install pyblue` or `pip install pyblue --upgrade`, or download it from
the [PyBlue PyPI](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyblue/) site.

**Note:** Version 2.0 of pyblue moved from Mako Templates to Django Templates and
with that introduced other semantic differences.

To install the last version of the `1.*` line use: `easy_install pyblue==1.1.2` or `pip install pyblue=1.1.2`.
See also the previous docs at: [Pyblue 1.1.2](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyblue/1.1.2)

Use
---

* Launch pyblue to serve a directory `pyblue serve -r docs/src`.
* View your site by visiting `http:://localhost:8080`.
* Edit your pages and make changes. Reload to page to see the effect.
* Finally, generate static output: `pyblue make -r docs/src -o docs/html`
* To see extra help on options run: `pyblue -h`

Context
-------

The pages are rendered through the Django Template engine.
Users automatically get additional context for each of the pages as
variables that exists.

For example the {% verbatim %}<code>{{ page }}</code>{% endverbatim %} variable is present:

* Writing: {% verbatim %}<code>{{ page.name }}</code>{% endverbatim %} will produce: {{ page.name }}
* Writing: {% verbatim %} <code>{{ page.last_modified }}</code> {% endverbatim %}
  will produce: {{ page.last_modified }}
* Writing: {% verbatim %} <code>{{ page.size|filesizeformat }}</code> {% endverbatim %}
  will produce: {{ page.size|filesizeformat }}

Note how in this last case we also made use of the code>filesizeformat</code> builtin filter from Django.

Users may add more information even load a python module into the page.

Read about how to add more {% link "context.html" %}.

Links
-----

To access more advanced features users must add the pyblue tag loader into each page:
{% verbatim %}<code>{% load pytags %}</code>{% endverbatim %}. You can now make use of specific tags.

For example {% verbatim %}<code>{% link "context.html" %}</code>{% endverbatim %} will
produce the following: {% link "context.html" %}.

Why? The {% verbatim %}<code>{% link "context.html" %}</code>{% endverbatim %}
command performs a regular expression search on all files in the directory and
once it finds a match it produces a link to it with the proper path.
This keeps links correct even after moving files! Note how in this
case the file is located in <code>info/context.html</code>

Note that the search string is used as a regular expression!
It is sufficient to specify the shortest unambiguous part of the file and PyBlue will find
it and link it.

Markdown
--------

To include markdown content place it between <code>markdown</code> template tags.

{% code "markdown-example.html" %}

Here is the result of processing the file above: {% link "markdown-example.html" %}

Files with `.md` extension will get rendered automatically as html: {% link "markdown-example.md" %}

Include
-------

To include syntax highlighted code write {% verbatim %}<code>{% code "context.py" %}</code>{% endverbatim %}

{% code "context.py" %}

Add {% verbatim %}<code>{% pygments_css %}</code>{% endverbatim %} to the header of the page to
generate the CSS classes needed to syntax color embedded code.

This file is also special because of its name. The contents of it are available in the page. For example
writing {% verbatim %}`{{ context.greeting }}`{% endverbatim %} produces: {{ context.greeting }}

Bootstrap
---------

There are helper methods for [Bootstrap][bootstrap].

For example {% verbatim %}<code>{% boostrap_cdn %}</code>{% endverbatim %} will include
the CSS and Javascript files used with Boostrap.

Licensing
---------

* PyBlue uses the [MIT license][license].
* PyBlue is being developed by Istvan Albert see https://github.com/ialbert
* PyBlue has been inspired by [PyGreen][pygreen] created by Nicolas Vanhoren see (https://github.com/nicolas-van/pygreen) but it does
  not use any code from it.
