Welcome to Pyblue
=================

A simple static site generator. Zero configuration. Works with any existing site.

PyBlue allows the reuse of data and visuals (header/footer) across many pages
and it can generate static sites from dynamic templates.

PyBlue also makes it easy to use [Markdown][markdown] inside of  webpages.

This file is located in <code><a href="https://github.com/ialbert/pyblue/tree/master/docs/index.html">docs/src/index.html</a></code>
of the <a href="https://github.com/ialbert/pyblue">PyBlue distribution</a>.


Why PyBlue?
----------

There is no shortage of static html generators. PyBlue is a personal project
that aims to address my personal annoyances with other options. I have evaluated
quite a few alternatives, some for many months yet slowly each drove me nuts.
Hence the motivation to write my own.
The following are some of the reasons why PyBlue exists:

1. Requires no configuration or predetermined directory/file naming. I hate
when software starts by imposing rules on what should go where.
1. Automatic linking! PyBlue keeps track of your links based on the file name.
You can move the files around to other directories and these
will be found and linked correctly.
1. Allows users to embed code/files with syntax highlighting.
1. Allows users to load data into every page. Data can either go into
each page as comments or a python module can be loaded that may contain
any python object.
1. Advanced templating. Users may use the [Django Templating][django] system and all
 that it offers.
1. [Bootstrap][bootstrap] integration. Handy shortcuts to Bootstrap features.
1. Tiny codebase. PyBlue is around 500 lines of code. Runs on Python 2.7 and 3.4 as well.

Install
-------

Install it with `easy_install pyblue` or `pip install pyblue --upgrade`, or download it from
the [PyBlue PyPI](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyblue/) site.

* Launch pyblue to serve a directory <code>pyblue serve -r docs/src</code>.
* View your site by visiting <code>http:://localhost:8080</code>.
* Edit your pages and make changes. Reload to page to see the effect.
* Finally, generate static output: <code>pyblue make -r docs/src -o docs/html</code>

Context
-------

The pages are rendered through the Django Template engine.
Users automatically get additional context for each of the pages as
variables that exists.


For example the {% verbatim %}<code>{{ page }}</code>{% endverbatim %} variable is present:

* Writing: {% verbatim %}<code>{{ page.name }}</code>{% endverbatim %} will produce: {{ page.name }}
* Writing: {% verbatim %} <code>{{ page.last_modified }}</code> {% endverbatim %}
  will produce: {{ page.last_modified }}
* Writing: {% verbatim %} <code>{{ page.size|filesizeformat }}</code> {% endverbatim %}
  will produce: {{ page.size|filesizeformat }}

Note how in this last case we also made use of the code>filesizeformat</code> builtin filter from Django.

Users may add more information even load a python module into the page.

Learn {% link "context.html" %}.

Links
-----

To access more advanced features users must add the pyblue tag loader into each page:
{% verbatim %}<code>{% load pytags %}</code>{% endverbatim %}. You can now make use of specific tags.

For example {% verbatim %}<code>{% link "context.html" %}</code>{% endverbatim %} will
produce the following: {% link "context.html" %}.

Why? The {% verbatim %}<code>{% link "context.html" %}</code>{% endverbatim %}
command performs a regular expression search on all files in the directory and
once it finds a match it produces a link to it with the proper path.
This keeps links correct even after moving files! Note how in this
case the file is located in <code>info/context.html</code>

Note that the search string is used as a regular expression! All a user needs
to specify is the shortest unambiguous part of the file and PyBlue will find
it and link it.

Markdown
--------

To include markdown content place it between <code>markdown</code> template tags.

{% code "markdown-example.html" %}

Here is the result of processing the file above: {% link "markdown-example.html" %}

Files with `.md` extension will get rendered automatically as html: {% link "markdown-example.md" %}

Include
-------

To include syntax highlighted code write {% verbatim %}<code>{% code "context.py" %}</code>{% endverbatim %}

{% code "context.py" %}

Now this file is also special because of its name. The contents of it are available in the page. For example
writing {% verbatim %}<code>{{ context.greeting }}</code>{% endverbatim %} produces: {{ context.greeting }}

Bootstrap
---------

There are helper methods for [Bootstrap][boostrap].

For example {% verbatim %}<code>{% boostrap_cdn %}</code>{% endverbatim %} will include
the CSS and Javascript files used with Boostrap.
