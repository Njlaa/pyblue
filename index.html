<h1>Welcome to PyBlue</h1>
<hr>
<p>A simple static site generator. Zero configuration. Works with any existing site.</p>
<p>PyBlue allows the reuse of data and visuals (header/footer) across many pages
and it can generate static sites from dynamic templates.</p>
<p>This page was created with PyBlue from the file located in <a href="https://github.com/ialbert/pyblue/tree/master/docs/index.html">docs/src/index.html</a>.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Why PyBlue?</h3>
<p>There is no shortage of static html generators. PyBlue is a personal project
that aims to address my personal annoyances with other options. I have evaluated
quite a few alternatives even used some options over longer periods
of time. Neither of the choices did everything I needed for my work.
Hence came the motivation to write my own static site generator.</p>
<p>The following are some of the reasons why PyBlue exists:</p>
<ol>
<li>Pyblue requires no initial configuration, special file naming scheme to get started.</li>
<li>Pyblue will work with existing html files. Every feature is optional!</li>
<li>Automatic linking!  Pyblue can be told to produce correct links automatically.</li>
<li>Reorganize the site at any time without having to worry about broken links.</li>
<li>Pyblue can embed and syntax highlight code.</li>
<li>Pyblue integrates seamlessly with Markdown.</li>
<li>Pyblue can be told to load data into any page. The template system can operate on this data.</li>
<li>Advanced templating <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django Templating</a> system and all that it offers.</li>
<li>Tiny codebase. PyBlue is around 500 lines of code. Runs on Python 2.7 and 3.4 as well.</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<h3>Install</h3>
<pre><code>pip install pyblue --upgrade
</code></pre>
<p>Or download it from the <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyblue/">PyBlue at PyPI</a>.
Alternatively to install the latest version:</p>
<pre><code>git clone git@github.com:ialbert/pyblue.git
cd pyblue
python setup.py develop
</code></pre>
<hr>
<h3>Usage</h3>
<ul>
<li>Launch pyblue to serve a directory <code>pyblue -r docs</code>.</li>
<li>View your site by visiting <code>http:://localhost:8080</code>.</li>
<li>Edit your pages and make changes. Reload the page to see your edits live.</li>
<li>Finally, generate static output with: <code>pyblue -r docs -o html</code></li>
</ul>
<p>To see extra help on options run: <code>pyblue -h</code></p>
<hr>
<h3>Features</h3>
<hr>
<h4>Context</h4>
<p>The pages are rendered through the <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.9/ref/templates/language/">Django Template</a> language.
To make use of the templating you need to understand how this templating language works.</p>
<p>There is extra data associated with each  page.
For example the
<code>{{ page }}</code> variable is available:</p>
<ul>
<li>Writing: <code>{{ page.name }}</code> will produce: Index</li>
<li>Writing:  <code>{{ page.last_modified }}</code>
will produce: Tuesday, April 12, 2016</li>
<li>Writing:  <code>{{ page.size|filesizeformat }}</code>
will produce: 9.4Â KB</li>
</ul>
<p>Note how in this last case we also made use of the <code>filesizeformat</code> builtin filter of Django.
Users may add more information even load a python module into the page.</p>
<p>More details on the <a class="" href="./info/context.html">Context</a> page.</p>
<hr>
<h4>Links</h4>
<p>To access more advanced features users must add the pyblue tag loader into each page:</p>
<p><code>{% load pytags %}</code>.</p>
<p>Once that is added to a page
users can make use of pyblue specific template tags. For exmple <code>link</code> is such a tag that find
files the directories and links them correctly.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>{% link "context.html" %}</code> will
produce the following: <a class="" href="./info/context.html">Context</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>{% link "context.html" text="Click the context now!" %}</code> will
produce the following: <a class="" href="./info/context.html">Click the context now!</a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Important: Note how in this case the file is located in <code>info/context.html</code> Yet we did not have
to put that into the linking tag. <code>PyBlue</code> found the file and linked it properly</p>
<p>How does that work? The <code>{% link "context.html" %}</code>
command performs a regular expression search on all files in the directory and
once it finds a match it produces a link to it with the proper relative path.
This keeps links correct even if the files were to be moved later.</p>
<p>Note that the search string is a regular expression that does not need a full path to the file.
It is sufficient to specify the shortest unambiguous part of the filename <code>PyBlue</code> will find
it and link it.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact this is one reason PyBlue was written. I got very tired of broken links
after a more logical reorganization of my sites. That is not a problem now.</p>
<hr>
<h4>Markdown</h4>
<p>To include markdown content place it between
<code>{% markdown %}</code> and <code>{% endmarkdown %}</code>
template tags.</p>
<hr>
<h4>Fenced code blocks</h4>
<p>When using markdown fenced codeblocks may be used. Include code between ``` symbols that can
also take language hints:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">import sys
for line in open("data.txt"):
    print line.strip()[:10]
</code></pre>
<hr>
<h4>Include code</h4>
<p>To include syntax highlighted code from a file write <code>{% code "context.py" lang="python" %}</code></p>
<pre><code class="language-python">#
# The data file named context.py in the root folder
# will be loaded automatically into the page.
#

NUMBERS = range(5)

# It may contain any valid python construct.

def say_hello(name):
    return "Hello %s" % name

greeting = say_hello("World!")
</code></pre>
<p>This file is also special because of its name: <code>context.py</code>. The contents of
this python module is available inside every page under the name of <code>context</code>.</p>
<p>For example writing <code>{{ context.greeting }}</code> produces: Hello World!.</p>
<p>This is where the full power of <code>pyblue</code> shows. You see, you can go wild and add any and all
data that you might need. Call out to any program, read any file etc. It is all <code>Python</code> in there.</p>
<hr>
<h4>Include markdown</h4>
<p>Alternatively one can instruct PyBlue to include the rendered content of markdown files.</p>
<p>To include <code>example.md</code> in original form one would use
<code>{% code "example.md" %}</code> this would produce:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">**Note**: This text comes from a **markdown** file.</code></pre>
<p>This same file could be included as html with <code>{% include_markdown "example.md" %}</code>
In that case it will produce the following:</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: This text comes from a <strong>markdown</strong> file.</p>
<hr>
<h4>Advanced templates</h4>
<p>The <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.9/ref/templates/language/">django templating</a> system allows extending or including other templates or sections.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>{% extend "sometemplate.html" %}</code></li>
<li><code>{% include "sometemplate.html" %}</code></li>
</ul>
<p>These features support template inheritance and composition.</p>
<hr>
<h4>Overriding templates</h4>
<p>By default all templates will be loaded from the root directory of your application
and if not found it will fall back to the <code>PyBlue</code> defaults.</p>
<p>Hence to override any
template just add that file with the same name. To override the <code>site_assets.html</code> that
contains the custom <code>css</code> and <code>js</code> modules create your own <code>site_assets.html</code> file in your project.</p>
<p>To help demonstrate how this works there is a simple example template tag called <code>{%  say_hello %}</code>
Normally this tag will create the output: Hello World! because it is using a template that contains:</p>
<pre><code>Hello World!
</code></pre>
<p>This template tag accesses the template file called <code>say_hello.html</code>.
If it does not find it in the current directory it falls back to the default location that is part of <code>PyBlue</code>.</p>
<p>In the <code>templates</code> folder of your root directory create the file <code>say_hello.html</code> that contains</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">Goodbye World!
</code></pre>
<p>Now running <code>{%  say_hello %}</code> will produce: Goodbye World!</p>
<hr>
<h4>Custom template tags</h4>
<p><code>PyBlue</code> comes with a few simple template tags such as <code>link</code> and <code>img</code> but it
also allows you to extend your templates with so called <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.9/howto/custom-template-tags/">custom template tags</a>.
There are some requirements nainly on naming.</p>
<p>For that to work your root directory must be an <code>import</code> ready python module.
This means a name that only has ascii characters and underscores and the root
directory must contain a file name <code>__ini__.py</code>. This file may be empty.</p>
<p>Once this is set up you may add your templatetags directory into the root folder as
desribed in the <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.9/howto/custom-template-tags/">custom template tags</a> documentation.</p>
<p>The <code>docs</code> root folder has its own <code>demotags</code> custom template tag</p>
<ul>
<li><code>{%  boom 'PyBlue' %}</code> will produce: BOOM! BOOM! POW! <b>PyBlue</b>!</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h4>Site assets</h4>
<p>Add <code>{% site_assets %}</code> to the head tag of the page to
generate the CSS classes needed to syntax color embedded code.</p>
<p>Override the template called <code>site_assets.html</code> to modify the assets.</p>
<hr>
<h4>Licensing</h4>
<ul>
<li>PyBlue uses the <a href="https://github.com/ialbert/pyblue/blob/master/LICENSE.txt">MIT license</a>.</li>
<li>PyBlue is being developed by Istvan Albert see <a href="https://github.com/ialbert">https://github.com/ialbert</a></li>
<li>PyBlue has been inspired by <a href="https://github.com/nicolas-van/pygreen">PyGreen</a> created by Nicolas Vanhoren see (<a href="https://github.com/nicolas-van/pygreen">https://github.com/nicolas-van/pygreen</a>) but it does
not use any code from it.</li>
