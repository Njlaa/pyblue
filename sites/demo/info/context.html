Context
=======

Templates have access to a default context that includes default variables. For example ${f.ok}

* the `f` variable that contains information
  on the current file. For example <%text filter="h">`${f.name}`</%text> will print this page's name: ${f.name}.
* the `p` is the class underlying the entire PyBlue instance. It has many
  neat properties. For example the `p.files`
  class attribute contains information on all files processed by PyBlue. Thus say
  <%text filter="h">`${len(p.files)}`</%text> will produce ${len(p.files)}


Each page may also contain any number of context values that will then be available to the page.

For example this page has the following metadata associated with it.

<%text filter="h">
    ##name Context
    ##sortkey 2
    ##tags home intro
</%text>

These context variables that have default values when not explicitly set as above.
One can access them directly like so `f.name`, `f.sortkey`, `f.tags` to produce ${f.name}, ${f.sortkey} and ${f.tags}

* `name` will be displayed in the links and title
* `sortkey` is the key by which table of contents are sorted
* `tags` are space separated words that can be used to select groups of pages

One may add any number of context variables for example

<%text filter="h">
    ##sample 123
    ##author John Doe
</%text>

That in turn will be assigned to the file object that renders the page.

Finally we can access the custom page via `f.meta["author"]` will produce ${f.meta['author']}

Go back to ${link("index")}
