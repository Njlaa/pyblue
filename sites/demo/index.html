Welcome to PyBlue
=================


The template inherits from [base.md.mako](https://github.com/ialbert/pyblue/blob/master/templates/base.md.mako)
and therefore its content will be interpreted in [Markdown](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) syntax.

If you are using the `pyblue serve` command you may change the content of this file and see the changes
live in your browser.

Context
-------

Templates have access to a default context that includes default variables. For example

* the `f` variable that contains information
  on the current file. For example <%text filter="h">`${f.name}`</%text> will print this page's name: ${f.name}.
* the `p` is the class underlying the entire PyBlue instance. It has many
  neat properties. For example the `p.files`
  class attribute contains information on all files processed by PyBlue. Thus say
  <%text filter="h">`${len(p.files)}`</%text> will produce ${len(p.files)}
* the `u` variable exposes a series of utility functions that come in handy when creating pages. These
  are defined in the `pyblue/utils.py` module. For example <%text filter="h">`${u.hello()`</%text> will produce ${u.hello()}


Learn more about context on the ${p.link(f, 'context')} page.


File Listing
------------

You can iterate over all files in the project:

${p.toc(f)}

These will be a sorted by the sortkey as explained in the ${p.link(f, 'context')} page.

Tagged
------

Tagged as `home`:

${p.toc(f, tag="home")}

Tagged as `data`:

${p.toc(f, tag="data")}

Navigation
----------

See examples of file navigation on the ${p.link(f, 'navigate')} page.
