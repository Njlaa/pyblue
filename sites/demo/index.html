Welcome to PyBlue
=================

PyBlue is a simple way to easily generate static files used to present data analysis reports.

Features
--------

* zero configuration - PyBlue requires no settings or initialization for existing sites
* add one line to each HTML file turn on the functiontality of the extension modules
* simple Markdown based rendering
* painless linking to all content within site
* create table of contents and galleries
* mark and group files with tags or with regular expression patterns
* uses python [Mako templates](http://www.makotemplates.org/) which means that there are no limitations to what you can do ;-)

The source of this file can be seen at [https://github.com/ialbert/pyblue/blob/master/sites/demo/index.html](https://github.com/ialbert/pyblue/blob/master/sites/demo/index.html)

* The template inherits from [base.md.mako](https://github.com/ialbert/pyblue/blob/master/templates/base.md.mako)
  so its content will be interpreted in [Markdown](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) syntax.
* If you are using the `pyblue serve` command you may change the content of this file and see the changes
  live in your browser.
* Importing the `extensions.mako` file enables a number of useful functions

File Listing
------------

You can iterate over all files in the project with `toc()` (Table of Contents). Users have
control over the order in which files are listed and the name of the links that
are displayed for each file:

${toc()}

The `toc()` command can filter the files by regex pattern or tags .

For example you can select files that match the word `base` with `toc(match='base')`:

${toc(match="base")}

Or you can filter by tags, to show files tagged `home` use `toc(tag='home')`

${toc(tag="home")}


Linking
-------

To link to an existing page match it with the `link(pattern)` command. For example `link('context')`
will produce ${link('context')}

Context
-------

Variables may be passed into each template. See the ${link('context')} page on how to add tags to files.

Galleries
---------

You can easily generate galleries from images with the `gallery()` command. For details see ${link('gallery')}
