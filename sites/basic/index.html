Welcome to PyBlue ${f.name}
=================

${files}

The template inherits from [base.md.mako](https://github.com/ialbert/pyblue/blob/master/templates/base.md.mako)
and therefore its content
is interpreted in [Markdown](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) syntax.

Also note that if you are using the `pyblue serve` command you may change
the content of this file and see the changes live in your browser.

Utility Functions
-----------------

You will need to look at the [source of this file](https://github.com/ialbert/pyblue/blob/master/sites/basic/index.html)
to understand how the content is generated.

Links
-----

These is the Table of Contents, all files that are contained in the project `x.toc(short=False)` :

${x.toc(short=False)}

The default behavior via `x.toc()` is to shorten the file names to make them more user friendly.
The names are auto generated from the file names:

${x.toc()}

The order of the files is alphabetic within each directory.

You may also pass a pattern to the link generator `x.toc(patt='pages', short=False)` to select only the files that match
that regular expression pattern.
For example here are the links where the url path starts with the word `pages`:

${x.toc(patt='pages', short=False)}

This too has long and short form `x.toc(patt='pages')` :

${x.toc(patt='pages')}

Other Functions
---------------

You may define other functionality in the templates, here we call the function `hello()` defined in the extension:

Invoked as <%text filter="h">`${x.hello()}`</%text>

It will produce ${x.hello()}

Internal links
--------------

Let's go to ${ x.link(patt=".*1") } with `x.link(patt=".*1")` This command will return the first
link that matches the pattern.
