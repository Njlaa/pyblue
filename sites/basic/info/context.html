More on Context
===============

Each page may also contain any number of context values that will then be available to the page.

For example this page has the following metadata associated with it.

<%text filter="h">
    ##name Context
    ##sortkey 1
    ##tags data test
</%text>

What this means is that the links generated to this page will have the word `Context` and
iterating over the files will be returned by the sortkey.
Finally we can access the page by name or tags

`f.meta["tags"]` will produce ${f.meta['tags']}

These three metafields will always be set.
