More Advanced Usage
-------------------

Including a `settings.py` file in the root folder allows the content of the file to be loaded
into each template via the `pygreen.settings` attribute.

Thus if the settings file contains

    name="John Doe"

You will be able to access that in the template via with `pygreen.settings.name`

When rendered will become: ${pygreen.settings.name}

Any other Python construct may be included in the settings file.

You can now jump back to the ${ x.link(root="..", patt="index") } but make sure
to pass the correct relative path to it with `x.link(root="..", patt="index")`
