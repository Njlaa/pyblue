=============

${f.rpath}

Note that since this file is in a different folder we refer to the inherited
templates as a relative path to the root folder.

The same will apply to generating links we will need to specify the
path to the root of the site.

${x.toc(root="..", short=False)}


Note Each template has access to the entire pygreen object that has the following attributes
For example in this page we can access the `pygreen` object to produce its attributes and
methods like so:

% for name in dir(pygreen):
* ${name}
% endfor

Some of them will be formatted as bold because the module name starts with underscore, that in turn
is interpreted as the bold character in Markdown.

Let's go to ${ x.link(root="..", patt=".*2") } with `x.link(root="..", patt=".*2")`
